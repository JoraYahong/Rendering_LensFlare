Rendering_LensFlare
====
In this final project, a method to interactively generate pseudo flare rendering for camera lenses is presented in real-time. The lens flare effects contain many components which are considered important for realism, such as ghosts, halos, chromatic distortion, lens dirt, diffraction starburst and blur effect. This method is not physically-based, however, it could be used as an alternative to it or an enhancement to the traditional sprite-based effect.

Results
-------
The project is implemented in GLSL and using C++ in Visual Studio 2017. The approach we used reaches a real-time lens flare effect interactively rendered based on the source image we choose. The result is shown below with original image and the image blended with our rendered lens flare.
